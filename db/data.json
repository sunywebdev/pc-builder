        "details": "AMD is preparing two variants for the sub-$150 US market, the Ryzen 5 3500X & the Ryzen 5 3500. Both processors feature 6 cores and 6 threads which means that there won't be multi-threading support on either chip, however, given their price point and the market they are aiming, a cut-down core configuration is expected. As such, these would be the first Ryzen 3000 parts with no multi-threading support. Starting off with the AMD Ryzen 5 3500X, we are looking at a base clock of 3.6 GHz and a boost clock of 4.1 GHz. The processor features 32 MB of cache, a 65W TDP and a price close to $150 US. It is highly liked that AMD would choose a $149.99 US price for this specific chip. In official slides posted by BullsLab, the chip comes with 24 PCIe Gen 4 lanes, support for 3200 MHz memory and we also get to take a look at some performance benchmarks where the chip is highly competitive.The Ryzen 5 3500, on the other hand, has pretty much the same specifications and even the same clock speeds of 3.6 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost. The difference is that it features 16 MB of cache versus 32 MB on the Ryzen 5 3600X. It would result in a small performance penalty but we are also looking at a lower price point. This processor also has 03 years warranty (No Warranty for Fan or Cooler)."

This processor is built with PCIe 3.0 x8 and Wraith Spire Thermal Solution. The AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Processor provides DDR4 Up to 3200MHz memory with 2 memory channels. It has AMD StoreMI Technology which is a fast and easy way to expand and accelerate the storage in a desktop PC with an AMD Ryzen processor. AMD StoreMI technology is a powerful tool for PC enthusiasts that want to improve load times, boot times, file management, or system responsiveness. Whatever your storage acceleration needs, AMD StoreMI technology automatically pairs your most-used files with an SSD cache for peak performance. MD StoreMI technology can get files running at SSD-like speeds. Simply add an SSD to your system and let StoreMI do the rest. It also has AMD \"Zen 3\" Core Architecture with the fastest cores in the world for PC gamers. The \"Zen 3\" architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the \"Zen\" era. Over 20 major changes include wider and more flexible execution resources; significantly more load/store bandwidth to feed execution; and a streamlined front-end to get more threads in flight and do it faster. The \"Zen 3\" architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation2. This is a historically large generational improvement in IPC and a major player in this architecture's ability to deliver unmatched single-core performance. The \"Zen 3\" architecture transitions to a new \"unified complex\" design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus the Zen 2. It also features the AMD Ryzen VR-Ready Premium for the best possible VR experience possible. AMD Ryzen 5 5600 Processor offers a 3-Year Warranty."

        "details": "Realtek 8118 LAN is a high performance and friendly network chip for gaming players with automatic bandwidth allocation to ensure the highest network priority of the game or application. It can provide users the most comprehensive features and the fastest and smoothest Internet experience. GIGABYTE Motherboards are focused on delivering M.2 technology to enthusiasts who want to maximize their systemâ€™s potential. Enjoy true HD display capability using the most commonly integrated digital output technologies on todayâ€™s HD displays and TVs. With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, but 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have also been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperatureâ€”all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level. Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during the initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier to use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."

Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperature, all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level.Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material that reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier-to-use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."

        "details": "Realtek 8118 LAN is a high performance and friendly network chip for gaming players with automatic bandwidth allocation to ensure the highest network priority of the game or application. It can provide users the most comprehensive features and the fastest and smoothest Internet experience. GIGABYTE Motherboards are focused on delivering M.2 technology to enthusiasts who want to maximize their systemâ€™s potential. With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, but 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have also been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperatureâ€”all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level. Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during the initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier to use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."

        "title": "Cooler Master MWE 450W V2 Non-Modular 80 Plus Bronze Power Supply",
        "details": "The MWE Bronze V2 offers a simple, reliable way to power your system safely and efficiently at a low cost. The 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency rating, DC-to-DC + LLC circuit design, single +12V rail, active PFC, and temperature sensitive HDB fan offer a power supply unit that stays true to its original purpose. This PSU will handle all your core computing needs with none of the hassles or challenges of additional specialty features, software synchronization, or other bells and whistles. Just plug it into your system and get to work. For a great mid-tier computing experience, you can't go wrong with the MWE Bronze V2.It's important to understand what efficiency is and what the ratings actually mean. The efficiency rating indicates how much power is retained and/or lost when transferring it from the wall to your components. It does not indicate the overall quality of the PSU. A PSU doesn't need an 80 PLUS Gold rating to be safe and reliable. And a PSU with an 80 PLUS Gold rating isn't necessarily either of those things. The MWE Bronze V2 guarantees a typical efficiency of 85% while being both safe and reliable.The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Bronze's solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the system's temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required.Getting power from the wall to the PSU and then to your components is a tricky situation. The power comes in one voltage level, but your components need a different one. That power has to first be transferred to/through a converter in order to make it safe for your parts to use without overloading. The lines/rails used to initially move power from the wall to the converter need to be reliable and consistent to ensure your system's overall performance. That's why the MWE Bronze only uses one +12V rail for this process. This way all the components in your system are constantly fed the same power from the same source in order to guarantee consistency between all connections.Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly. The process of converting raw power from the wall to the multiple voltage levels your components need requires special components to complete this process quickly, efficiently, and safely. The MWE Bronze's DC-to-DC + LLC technology was painstakingly crafted to accomplish this goal. The Dual Forward circuit layout has been designed to convert 12V power to 3V and 5V levels with minimal ripple noise, 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency, and reduced risk to your connected components.For many PC Builders with aesthetics in mind, cabling can be one of the most troublesome parts of assembling a PC. Cables can be confusing, too short or too long, and they almost never look good. The MWE Bronze - V2 uses flat and flexible black cables to help deal with these problems. These cables are more discrete and flexible, making them easier to implement into your system while taking up less space. This is especially useful for smaller cases and preserving airflow."
